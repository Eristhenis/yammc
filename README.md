        Yet Another Midas Miner Clone

        My hobby project to create a Midas Miner Clone, the artwork/fonts
        is not mine and I consider it to be public domain. If someone
        disagree please let me know and I will remove it.

        I have spent the last 30 years developing software but the last game
        I wrote was a Tetris clone for the Hercules graphic card back in 1989.

        Still plenty of work to do
